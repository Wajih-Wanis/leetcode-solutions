"""
The intuition for this solution is that a word could be presented as a tree. More likely if for example word: bad and bake would have
a common root which 'ba' and thus building this data structure would allow us to navigate the whole tree to either look for the existance
of a full word or the pattern given by points. Of course the first thing that would come to the mind for this travesal that it should be 
a dfs traversal.
